                <p className="mb-6">
                    Our belief is that AI will power many applications in legal, healthcare, and finance. But none are more important than building AI that can build the world around us—especially the physical infrastructure that will accelerate the development of AI.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    Sam Altman writes in a 2025 blog post (The Gentle Singularity):
                </p>

                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-zinc-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic text-zinc-700">
                    "[If AI] can operate the entire supply chain—digging and refining minerals, driving trucks, running factories, etc.—to build more robots, which can build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, etc, then the rate of progress will obviously be quite different."
                </blockquote>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    It has become clear that OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic will continue to release increasingly powerful foundation models that are capable of building the factories of the future, designing the food we eat, and managing fleets of robots that will build the world around us.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    But models need a delivery mechanism to support their interaction with the world. Without tools, environments, and verification systems, models fail to deliver the results they promise.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    Harvey distributes AI for the world's leading law firms. Waymo is another example with a more nuanced environment, self-driving, where even one mistake from an AI is consequential.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    Our software is the distribution layer for powerful AI models that will build the world.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    We support ClarkDietrich, the country's leading steel building systems manufacturer. They produce the steel beams that make up Intel's new data center and Tesla's factories. Our tools help them to sell, manufacture, and supply their products.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    Our customer Schreiber Foods is one of the world's largest dairy producers. Their products make up the yogurt, milk, and cheese we buy at the supermarket. We accelerate their R&D processes, helping design new sustainable foods of the future.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    We serve Cabot, a 143-year storied publicly-listed chemicals manufacturer. They make the basis for every component in a car: tires, engine mounts, coatings, and tints, as well as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and more. We help them make and sell new chemicals.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-6">
                    While labs build the models of the future, we build the last-mile delivery for them. We must model complex environments, deliver reliable results, and bridge the gap between models and the antiquated ecosystems in which they must operate.
